# Course Materials

Dates shown are due dates (for readings, assignments, portfolio). In cases where this site and Canvas disagree, assume the earlier date is true (for readings) and go with the date on Canvas for homework assignments. 

Most classes will not contain slide presentations, but when there are slides to share, they will be provided here.
