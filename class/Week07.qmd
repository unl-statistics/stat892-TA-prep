## Activity

- Write definition you'd give your students of sampling distribution

- As a class: come up with 1 definition of sampling distribution based on the individual ones

Based on that definition, 

- identify benchmarks for student understanding
    - key parts
    - what students really need to understand to fully comprehend definition
    - what kind of questions would you ask them to see if they've achieved those benchmarks


## Journaling

- writing activity to explore sampling distribution and which benchmarks it reinforces

## Assignment

Write a question which assesses whether students understand sampling distributions based on the key benchmarks identified in class.
