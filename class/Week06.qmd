## Writing
- Discuss differences/similarities between 
    - parent distribution
    - sampling distribution
    - data distribution
- Where does 'probability distribution' fit in?

## Simulation

- Explore distribution of min, max, median, range
- 3 distributions - unimodal, skewed, crazy
- plotted on board
- which are parent, sampling, and data distributions?
- which are approximate? theoretical?

- What would have to be modified to explore sample size?


## Assignment

Modify simulation to explore sample size.
Submit 2-3 lecture slides on canvas exploring the effect of sample size on the sampling distribution.
